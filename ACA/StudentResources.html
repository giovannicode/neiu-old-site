<p class="context">Academic and Career Advising provide students with the tools and resources to discover, define and accomplish their academic and career goals.  Academic advisors provide academic and developmental advising for all undergraduate students who have not declared majors. Students remain with their University advisors until they declare a major, at which time the major department will assign a major advisor. Academic Advisors are available for students interested in pre-law and pre-professional health sciences programs. Career advisors assist students in developing appropriate major and career options through individual appointments, assessments, job fairs, and workshops. Career advisors also assist alumni with the successful transition of their academic credentials to the workforce. Academic and Career advisors help students to take responsibility for their academic choices in support of their career aspirations.  </p>

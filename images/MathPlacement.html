<h3>Math Placement Test</h3>

<p class="context">The Math Placement Test (MPT) evaluates your initial course readiness to be successful in mathematics at NEIU. <strong>The University does not allow students to register for any mathematics course without prior testing (MPT or ACT) <u>or</u> prior coursework.  <br />
  <br />
  </strong><strong>FRESHMAN STUDENTS<br />
</strong>Entering   freshman students are given two options for placement into a math   course:  ACT scores or the Math Placement Test (MPT).  Freshmen who   submit ACT scores to the university can be placed directly into a math   course based solely on their ACT math score.  They also have the option   of taking the Math Placement Test (MPT), in which case the university   will use the higher of the two scores for placement into a math course.    Since there is no penalty to taking the MPT, freshmen are strongly   encouraged to do so, particularly if they took a math course in their   senior year of high school.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Freshmen with Math ACT scores of 21 or less are given the Basic   MPT.  The Basic MPT is one hour consisting of a thirty minute test in   Elementary Algebra and a thirty minute test in Intermediate Algebra.    Students with Math ACT scores of 22 or higher are given the Advanced   MPT.  The Advanced MPT is one hour consisting of a thirty minute test in   Intermediate Algebra and a thirty minute test in Pre-Calculus. <br />
  </li>
  <li>Freshmen who do not submit ACT scores must take the Basic MPT.<br />
  </li>
  <li>Freshmen who receive a score of ‘3’ or higher on the AP Calculus test are not required to take Mathematics Placement Test.</li>
</ul>
<p class="context"><strong>TRANSFER STUDENTS<br />
</strong>Transfer students who have not   successfully completed college-level coursework in mathematics at their   prior institution are required to take the Math Placement Test.  The   exceptions to this policy are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Transfer students who receive a grade of ‘C’ or better in   Intermediate Algebra at their transfer institution do not need to take   the MPT. However, since Intermediate Algebra is not a college-level   course, they will be required to provide proof of course completion, in   the form of a transcript, to the Mathematics Department in order to   obtain permission to register for additional math courses at NEIU. <br />
  </li>
  <li>Transfer students who have submitted their ACT scores can be placed into a math course based solely on their ACT math score.</li>
</ul>
<p class="context"><strong><a name="Preparing for the Math Placement Test: Practice Tests" id="Preparing for the Math Placement Test: Practice Tests"></a>PREPARING FOR THE MATH PLACEMENT TEST: PRACTICE TESTS<br />
</strong>Students are <u><u>strongly </u></u>encouraged to review for the MPT.

<p class="context">Please note: Calculators are not allowed to be used during MPT testing.</p>
<p class="context"><strong>TEST REGISTRATION<br />
</strong>Registration for the Math   Placement Test can be done in person at the Academic Advisement and   Testing Center, located in Lech Walesa Hall, LWH 0027 or by phone at   773-442-5293. Refer to the current test schedule. Any cancellations or   changes must be made 48 hours in advance. </p>
<p class="context"><strong>RESULTS AND SCORE INTERPRETATION<br />
</strong>Math Placement   Test results are available approximately 1 week after the test. Students   may obtain results from the Academic Advisement and Testing Center,   located in Lech Walesa Hall, Room LWH 0027, upon presentation of a photo   ID. You may call us at (773) 442-5293 to check if the results are in   however, we cannot give results over the phone.</p>
